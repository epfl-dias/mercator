# Mercator Workspace

This repository references everything needed to build various tools related to the Spatial Index.

## Mercator: Spatial Index

**Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the [Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu). It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/) service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.

It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.

## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit

**Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.

Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the developper to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by the specific indices provided.

This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the underlying data structure, and re-used.

## Requirements

### Software

 * Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org

## Quick start

 * Clone the workspace, which will take care of bringing all the repositories needed.

   ```sh
   git clone --recurse git@gitlab.epfl.ch:DIAS/PROJECTS/HBP-SP5/mercator.git
   ```

   The following steps assume the working directory is the root of the mercator repository.

 * **[Optional]** Create 3 datasets, of 1, 10 and 100 features respectively, each with 1000 positions:

   ```sh
   cd mercator_data_generator
   cargo run --release -- 1 10 100
   ```

 * Index the data:

   ```sh
   cd mercator_indexer
   for f in ../mercator_data_generator/1*.json
   do
   	ln -s $f
   done
   cargo run --release -- 1k 10k 100k
   ```

 * Run the Spatial Index, while providing one of the datasets. Currently only one dataset (core) can be loaded at a time.

   ```sh
   cd mercator_service
   for f in ../mercator_indexer/*.index
   do
   	ln -s $f
   done
   RUST_LOG="warn,actix_web=info,mercator_service=trace" \
     MERCATOR_IMPORT_DATA="100k" \
     MERCATOR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3200" \
     cargo run --release
   ```
